# BlazorEmptyProject
Visual Studio project template for creating empty blazor projects.

I needed this template because every time creating a blazor project, I found myself either painstakingly removing everything from the blazor template, or adding blazor to an empty core project and setting up routing, namespaces, the entire frame. So I made a project template completely devoid of any pages, any CSS frameworks. This is the bare minimum of a blazor project. Please enjoy.

## Installation
Download a release, do not unpack the zip file. Place it in your _%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio ####\Templates\ProjectTemplates_ folder.

## "Compiling" from source
There's no compiling. Just take the contents of _src_ folder from this repository, put it in a zip file, and you have yourself a working build.
